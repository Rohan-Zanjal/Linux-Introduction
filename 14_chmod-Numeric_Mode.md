Certainly! Here's a table that explains chmod numeric mode along with permission types and symbols:

| Number | Permission Type | Symbol |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 0      | No permission   | ---    |
| 1      | Execute         | --x    |
| 2      | Write           | -w-    |
| 3      | Write, execute  | -wx    |
| 4      | Read            | r--    |
| 5      | Read, execute   | r-x    |
| 6      | Read, write     | rw-    |
| 7      | Read, write, execute | rwx |

Explanation:

- The "Number" column represents the numeric values used in chmod.
- The "Permission Type" column describes the types of permissions: read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`).
- The "Symbol" column displays the symbols used in symbolic notation.

For example:
- Permission `rwx` has a numeric mode of `7`.
- Permission `rw-` has a numeric mode of `6`.
- Permission `---` has a numeric mode of `0`.

To illustrate how chmod numeric mode works:

Let's say we have a file named `example.txt` with the following permissions: `-rw-r--r--`.

- To change the permissions to `rwxr-xr-x` using numeric mode, we would use:
  ```
  chmod 755 example.txt
  ```
  Here, `7` represents `rwx` for the owner, and `5` represents `r-x` for the group and others.

- To change the permissions to `rw-rw-r--` using numeric mode, we would use:
  ```
  chmod 664 example.txt
  ```
  Here, `6` represents `rw-` for the owner and group, and `4` represents `r--` for others.

You can use the `ls -l` command to check the permissions of files. It will display the permissions in symbolic notation. For example:
```
ls -l example.txt
```

This command will output something like:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Feb 21 12:00 example.txt
```

This indicates that `example.txt` has `-rw-r--r--` permissions.
