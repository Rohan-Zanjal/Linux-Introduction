 ##### The booting process in Linux can be broken down into several stages. 

#### 1. BIOS/UEFI:  
When you turn on your computer, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or 
 Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check 
 the hardware components like RAM, CPU, and storage devices. Then, it looks for the bootloader.

#### 2. Master Boot Record (MBR):   
The BIOS/UEFI locates the MBR, which is stored in the first sector (sector 0)
of the bootable storage device (typically a hard disk drive or SSD). The MBR contains a small piece of code
known as the bootloader.

#### 3. Bootloader (GRUB):  
The bootloader (such as GRUB) is loaded from the MBR into memory.
Its primary job is to load the Linux kernel into memory and start the operating system. 
GRUB may also present a menu of available operating systems if you have multiple installed.

#### 4. Linux Kernel:     
Once the bootloader has loaded, it loads the Linux kernel into memory.
The kernel is the core of the operating system. 
It initializes hardware components, mounts the root filesystem, and starts the init process.

#### 5. Init Process: 
The init process (or its modern replacements like systemd) is started by the kernel. 
It initializes the rest of the operating system, starting essential system services and daemons 
defined in the system configuration.

#### 6. Runlevel programs

Runlevels in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, are predefined operating states that determine
which services, daemons, and programs are allowed to run. Each runlevel is associated with a different set of
system services, and the system can only be in one runlevel at a time. Historically, runlevels were used to manage
the startup and shutdown processes of the system, although modern systems often use alternative methods such as
systemd targets.

###### Here's a brief overview of the traditional runlevels commonly found in Linux distributions:

#### * Runlevel 0 (Halt/Shut Down):    ``` runlevel0.target``` is a symbolic link to ```poweroff.target```
This runlevel shuts down the system. All processes are terminated, and the system is powered off.

#### * Runlevel 1 (Single User Mode):   ```runlevel1.target``` is a symbolic link to ```rescue.target```
Also known as single-user mode or maintenance mode, this runlevel is used for system maintenance tasks.
It provides a minimal environment with only essential services running,
typically allowing only the root user to log in. It's often used for troubleshooting and system recovery.

#### * Runlevel 2 (Multi-User Mode, without Networking):   ```runlevel3.target``` is a symbolic link to ```multi-user.target```
This runlevel is similar to runlevel 3 but does not start networking services. 
It's suitable for systems that don't require network connectivity, such as standalone servers or workstations.

#### * Runlevel 3 (Multi-User Mode, with Networking):   ```runlevel3.target``` is a symbolic link to ```multi-user.target```
This is the standard multi-user mode with networking enabled.
It starts all essential system services, including networking,
and allows multiple users to log in and use the system concurrently.
This is the default runlevel for many server-oriented distributions.

#### * Runlevel 4 (Unused):   ```runlevel3.target ``` is a symbolic link to ```multi-user.target```
Historically, this runlevel was reserved for custom configurations,
but it's not commonly used in most Linux distributions.

#### * Runlevel 5 (Graphical Mode):  ``` runlevel5.target ```is a symbolic link to ``` graphical.target```
This runlevel is similar to runlevel 3 but includes a graphical user interface (GUI) login manager,
allowing users to log in and interact with the system using a graphical desktop environment.

#### * Runlevel 6 (Reboot):   ```runlevel6.target``` is a symbolic link to ```reboot.target```
This runlevel reboots the system. All processes are terminated, and the system is restarted.
